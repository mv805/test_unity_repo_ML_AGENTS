# Unity Tutorial Project

This repository started as a small Unity starter with good Git hygiene and formatting checks. It's now focused on tutorial work: teaching Unity scripting patterns, small gameplay experiments (like the Obstacle behavior), and standard repo practices. Git and CI remain important but are secondary â€” they support the learning workflow.
